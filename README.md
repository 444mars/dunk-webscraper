Hello everyone, My name is Mario Villatoro I’m a student UT Arlington. And I’m Kevin Shiflett, a student at the University of Maryland.
We are thankful to be given the opportunity to speak here today about our experience with the SEP internship so far. We would be lying if we said we weren’t nervous on our first day. Coming in on our first week, we had no idea what to expect for the summer. It is hard to believe we are over halfway through this internship, but the past six weeks have proven to be exciting and enriching. 
During our onboarding, we were introduced to our team and managers. It can be nerve-wracking jumping into a new environment, but our team has made us feel welcome from day one. In just six weeks we feel like we truly belong here and that we can call our team not only co-workers but friends. After becoming accustomed to the team and completing the mountain of HR trainings, we were given the rundown of our project. We were tasked with integrating the latest IOS developments into a mock of the benefits dashboard. This allowed us to discover the pros and cons of migrating to the latest IOS features and report these findings to our team. Here we have a demo of what we have built out, to the naked eye it appears to be the benefits dashboard but behind the scenes, we are using Apple's latest updates to their user interface library that could help improve layout performance. As you can see, the app is able to dynamically layout content with ease.
The project has given us hands-on experience solving a complex problem that not only relates to the work we would want to do as returning engineers, but our findings during this project could even benefit our team in the future. This internship has given us the opportunity to liv  s s the day-to-day experience of being a software engineer. By joining daily standup, participating in stories, and having check-ins with our managers, we have gained experience that cannot be found inside a classroom. It has been an enriching experience to work with cross-functional teams, as we have witnessed how the efforts of managers, product, and engineers come together to deliver high-quality products to millions of customers. This collaborative approach has given us valuable insight into the development of Chase’s user-centric products and has allowed us to deliver a complex project that could provide a lot of value to our team.
However, above all, the most rewarding part of our internship on the benefits team has been the people. The culture here is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open. We feel incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by such smart, dedicated, and fun individuals who are always willing to help, share knowledge, and encourage us.
